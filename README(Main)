Purpose of this program:

The patient wants to either book an appointment or verify the appointment is booked so they open the chatbot:
- The chatbot asks if there is an appointment already booked, if the user replies with any positive answer from the array 
  the apointment is verified by either actually saving appointment dates or checking if date is valid.
- If the user responds with any negative answer that matches any string in the array, the chabot offers to book an appointment ( we can actually save info and record them
  into an csv or just display info afte it's done)
- Every stage of the conversation is a level:
Level 0: Registration
Level 1: Verify if meeting is booked
Level 2: Verify date

Level 3 - 9 Could be additional requests that can be implemented
